- But if you want to select a box with 12 bottles of wine, you have to move to the previous menu

- Also, you can go and take one combo 
```
  /combo,
```
-  going back to the last menu.

When you feel you don't want to buy anything, go to your car 
```
/car
``` 
and see how much you expect to spend.

```
/single, /box or /combo
```
 but if you want to stop, try typing 
 ```
 "/stop."
 ```
