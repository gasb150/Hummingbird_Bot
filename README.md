# Hummingbird Bot

In this project, I made a bot to help clients have a quotation for a wine sale.

In this project, I make a Telegram wine quote bot using the API given by the BotFather from telegram. I choose a Hummingbird_Bot, because I have my handcrafted wine business, and I think this project could help in the future in how we can go to more people.
# Descrition
With this bot: 
you can move within options, using the assigned typings. 
you can choose different flavors for  single bottles, boxes with 12 bottles of wine each one and/or take combos.

- But if you want to select a box with 12 bottles of wine, you have to move to the previous menu

```
/back
